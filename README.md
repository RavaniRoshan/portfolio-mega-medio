# OS Portfolio: An Interactive Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, designed to look and feel like a modern operating system's file explorer. It's a unique way to browse my projects, learn about my skills, and even interact with an AI image generator.

**[Live Demo](https://your-live-demo-link-here.com)**

## Introduction

Welcome to my interactive portfolio! This project was built to showcase my work in a more engaging and creative way than a traditional portfolio website. You can navigate through folders, open files to learn more about me and my work, and explore the different sections of my digital "desk".

## Features

*   **Interactive File System:** Navigate a simulated file system with folders and files.
*   **AI Image Generator:** Create unique images using the Gemini API.
*   **Project Showcase:** Detailed views for each project, including descriptions, technologies, and images.
*   **Light & Dark Mode:** Switch between light and dark themes for your preferred viewing experience.
*   **File Search:** Quickly find files and projects using the search bar.
*   **Responsive Design:** Works on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
*   **Cool Animations:** Smooth animations with Framer Motion.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **Animations:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
*   **AI:** [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**

    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## File System Structure

The portfolio is organized into the following main files and folders:

*   **`README.md`**: A welcome file with a quick guide to the portfolio.
*   **`/Projects`**: A folder containing my key projects, categorized into:
    *   **`/AI & Automation`**: Projects related to artificial intelligence and automation.
    *   **`/Web & Productivity`**: Web development and productivity-related projects.
*   **`About Me.txt`**: A text file with information about my background and skills.
*   **`Certificates.md`**: A list of my professional certifications.
